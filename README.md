## Instructions

[You can download binaries of the latest release](https://github.com/gibbed/Gibbed.MT/releases/latest) (not the source ZIP!).

If you're not working with `Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen` you will probably want to edit `bin\projects\current.txt` and change it to one of the following:
* `Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen`
* `Dragon's Dogma (360)`
* `Dragon's Dogma (PS3)`
* `Dragon's Dogma Online`
* `Resident Evil 5`

Alternatively, you can override the current project on the command line with the `-p` switch. IE: `-p "Resident Evil 5"`.

## TODO

* Everything.
